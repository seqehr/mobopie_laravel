# Sanctum/Flutter authentication example: Backend

A Laravel API that uses the [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum) package to handle authentication with a mobile app (see [this repo](https://github.com/unlikenesses/sanctum-flutter-app) for an example).

This project is only intended to demonstrate what Sanctum can do. It is not recommended to use it as a model for your own projects.
